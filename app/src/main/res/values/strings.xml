    <string name="about_michael">
         I see myself as a highly motivated, independently working physicist
        with experiences in international research, leadership and data science."\n"
         Over the course of my university studies I was repeatedly able to
        show my capabilities to get to grips with topics of cutting-edge physical research
        and was able to work an successfully peer-reviewed publications."\n"
         In the last years I additionally developed a strong interest in
        the automation of recurring procedures and the creation of mobile android applications,
        during my university years, and would like to develop myself in this direction.
